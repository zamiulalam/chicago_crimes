# Chicago_Crimes

A jupyter notebook which analyzes the crime data of Chicago from 2001 to 2024. How different types of crimes are distributed among the different community areas is presented in this project. We also explore how demographics affect crimes rates in 2023.

A version with the interactive maps can be found at (https://nbviewer.org/github/zamiulalam/chicago_crimes/blob/a061cfc7c81c6725ab3baba585d9ba687be1a1bd/Chicago_Crimes.ipynb).

The notebook Chicago_Crimes.ipynb explores the distribution of different types of crimes and how it has varied throughout the years.

The notebook Income_crime_corr.ipynb shows the correlation of income and different demographics with the total number of crimes in 2023.
